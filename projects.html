					<h2>milling machine clean-up kit</h2>
					<p><i>may 2024 - present</i></p>
					<p>As a graduate student at McMaster University I taught machining labs in the mechanical engineering machine shop. Over the course of the three-hour lab, a group of five students, each on their own milling machine, would manufacture a small aluminum part from a piece of stock material. The last 40-45 minutes of each lab session was reserved for clean-up, which often meant that groups would not have enough time to finish their parts. After my first year as a lab TA, I decided to design a system that would simplify the milling machine clean-up process, hopefully shortening the time lost during each lab. I designed and built several accessories, which I continue to refine and test in my spare time.</p>

					<p>This website has been an ongoing project since high school, and has gone through many incarnations since then. The original intention of the project was to create an online profile for myself while also learning about web design. I have always tried to keep the site 100% my own work, avoiding the use of online templates or code snippets. With the latest version of this site (the one you're seeing now), I've challenged myself to never "vibe code" this site (but I still consult online resources like Stack Overflow when I hit a roadblock). The website is a constant work in progress, so you might discover some issues that I have yet to resolve.</p>

					<h2>pneumatic impactor for biomedical research</h2>
					<p><i>september 2023 - april 2024</i></p>
					<p>For our final-year engineering capstone project, my group and I were tasked with redesigning and rebuilding a pneumatic impactor for the McMaster Injury Biomechanics Laboratory. The device is essentially a large stainless steel potato gun that uses compressed air to launch a carefully designed projectile into a test specimen (protective equipment, surrogate tissue, cadaveric specimens). The objective was to redesign the device with improved ergonomics, a higher impact velocity, and a wider range of projectile sizes, and to relocate the apparatus to a new lab space. For this project I spent a lot of time in the machine shop, using the drill press, lathe, and milling machine, as well as welding.</p>
