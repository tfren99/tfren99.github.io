					<h2>Milling Machine Clean-Up Kit</h2>
					<p><i>May 2024 - Present</i></p>
					<p>As a graduate student at McMaster University I teach machining labs in the mechanical engineering machine shop. The labs are three hours long, and during that time students are expected to manufacture a small part from aluminum stock. Milling is messy, and the last 45 minutes of each lab session is reserved for clean-up. The milling process is too long to comfortably fit into two hours and 15 minutes, so students are often unable to finish their parts before clean-up begins. After my first year as a lab TA, I decided to design a system that would simplify the milling machine clean-up process, with the goal of shortening the time lost to clean up and maximizing the number of students that finish their parts.</p>

					<p><i>September 2018 - Present</i></p>
					<p>This website has been an ongoing project since high school. The original intention of the project was to create an online profile for myself while also learning about web design. With the latest version of this site (the one you're seeing now), I've challenged myself to code everything from scratch, and never "vibe code" or copy-paste from online. The website is a constant work in progress, so you might discover some issues that I have yet to resolve.</p>

					<h2>Pneumatic Impactor for Injury Biomechanics Research</h2>
					<p><i>September 2023 - April 2024</i></p>
					<p>For our engineering capstone project, my group and I were tasked with redesigning and rebuilding a pneumatic impactor for the McMaster Injury Biomechanics Laboratory. The device is essentially a large stainless steel potato gun that uses compressed air to launch a projectile into a test specimen (protective equipment, surrogate tissue, cadaveric specimens). The oiriginal device was over ten years old and no longer met the lab's needs, so we were tasked with redesigning the device with improved ergonomics, a higher impact velocity, and a wider range of projectile sizes. </p>
