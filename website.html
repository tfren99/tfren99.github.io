			<li>Personal project</li>

		<p class="main_text">This website is a project that I have been working on for many years. I have overhauled it several times as my design tastes change with time. With this iteration, I've challenged myself to code the entire website myself, without using any public templates or copy-pasting from any online forums or GPT chatbots. The site is hosted through Github pages, and the source code can be found on my <a class="intext" href="https://github.com/tfren99/tfren99.github.io">Github profile</a>.</p>
