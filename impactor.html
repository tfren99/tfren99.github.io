		<h2>description</h2>

		<p class="main_text">For our final-year capstone project, my group was tasked with redesigning a pneumatic impacting apparatus for the McMaster Injury Biomechanics Laboratory. The device is an important piece of equipment in their lab, used to simulate various types of impact injuries (a hockey puck hitting a helmet, a projectile hitting a human bone). It is made up of two structures: the impactor, which includes a compressed air tank and an "acceleration tube", and a specimen chamber which houses the specimen that is being tested. Depending on the size and mass of the projectile, different diameter acceleration tubes can be swapped in and out. The tube is also meant to move laterally in order to accurately pick an impact location. </p>

		<p class="main_text">The existing apparatus was functional but had several issues that needed resolving. To determine exactly what needed to be fixed, we sat down with the director of the lab (our project supervisor) and several of her grad students who use the impactor. That conversation allowed us to make a list of issues with the current apparatus that we had to solve:</p>

		<ul class="main_text">
			<li>Ergonomics: the impactor was too far off the ground, which made it difficult to swap out and load the acceleration tubes.</li>
			<li>Tube diameter: the existing design only accomodated a 3-inch diameter and 4-inch diameter tube. A 2-inch diameter tube was desired for higher impact speeds.</li>
			<li>Projectile loading: with the current system, the user had to disconnect the tube from the compressed air tank, lift the projectile (weighing up to 20kg) up into the tube, and then reconnect the air tank.</li>
			<li>Projectile rotation: the projectile was prone to random rotations as it travelled down the tube, and would exit the tube in a different orientation than it was loaded. While not a problem for some impact experiments, this was an issue for more specific geometries, like hockey pucks.</li>
			<li>Relocation: the new device was to be relocated to a new lab space.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="main_text">We got to work designing, proposing, and redesigning, and after several months of iteration we had a new design that addressed each of the previously outlined concerns. The new apparatus would be a combination of existing pieces, machined parts, and off-the-shelf components. For our design, we lowered the acceleration tube to table height, and we designed a custom steel structure to support the specimen chamber. We also designed a modular and adjustable clamp system to affix the tube to the table. The clamps were compatible with the existing 3-inch and 4-inch tubes, as well as with a new 2-inch tube that we purchased. To solve the projectile rotation issue, we customized the new tube with an internal keyway (made from aluminum extrusion), and a corresponding projectile was designed. A new wye-fitting allowed us to separate the compressed air intake from the projectile loading port. We also designed a platform to extend the length of the table.</p>

		<p class="main_text">We built the specimen chamber support out of 2-inch square steel tube, which we ordered to size and then welded ourselves. We also painted the structure with a rust-proof coating. The specimen chamber needed to be perfectly level but the new lab floor was very uneven, so we designed the structure with adjustable leveling feet.</p>

		<p class="main_text">The adjustable tube clamp system was made of custom 3D-printed clamps that can slide a long a length of aluminum extrusion. The inner diameter of the clamps is 4 inches, and they have inserts that can be used to reduce the diameter to 3 or 2 inches. The clamp components were printed with 8 wall loops, and I manufactured steel retainers to hold everything in place. We also engraved the aluminum extrusions with a ruler, making it much easier to position the tube.</p>

		<p class="main_text">The clamps were mounted to a table that we managed to acquire from another lab on campus that was in the process of downsizing. I had to wheel the table across campus to get it to the new lab space.</p>

		<p class="main_text">The original plan was for our team to move the compressed air tank and specimen chamber to the new lab, and hand over a fully tested device that was ready to use. Unfortunately, due to conflicts with ongoing research in the lab, we were unable to move the apparatus before the end of the school year. The apparatus was relocated the following year and has since been tested and approved for use by the department health and safety team, and is now being used for graduate level research.</p>

		<p class="main_text">This was a group project, with each member playing a different role and contributing different elements to the final design. My roles and contributions were:</p>

		<ul class="main_text">
			<li>Design and manufacture of the specimen chamber support structure.</li>
			<li>Design and manufacture of the tube clamp system.</li>
			<li>Design and manufacture of the 2-inch keyed tube.</li>
			<li>CAD work, budget tracking, report writing, and handling the project turnover to the graduate students.</li>
		</ul>
