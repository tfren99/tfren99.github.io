		<h1>About me</h1>

		<div class="underline"></div>

		<p class="main_text">I earned my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering with a specialization in smart systems from McMaster University in June 2024. I also completed a Minor in Mathematics. In September 2024 I joined the <a class="intext" href="https://ice.gadsden.xyz/">Intelligent and Cognitive Engineering Laboratory</a> where I am working towards a master's degree in mechanical engineering.</p>	
		
		<p class="main_text">My research at the ICE Lab centres on fault detection and condition monitoring for robotic manipulators with a focus on space applications. I am currently working with a team of graduate students to design and build a custom 7-degree-of-freedom robot arm equipped with powerful motors and high-resolution sensors. My goal is to use the robot to build a robust dataset of common manipulator fault signatures, and using this dataset I will develop novel estimation theory- and machine learning-based fault detection techniques.</p>

		<p class="main_text">As part of my research, I have written a <a class="intext" href="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/13483/1348307/Estimation-strategies-for-fault-detection-in-a-6-degree-of/10.1117/12.3053379.short">conference paper</a> which I presented at SPIE DCS in Florida in April 2024, as well as a <a class="intext" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5958875">journal article</a> that is currently under review. I intend to publish one more journal article before I defend my thesis in August 2026.</p>

		<p class="main_text">I am also a teaching assistant in the mechanical engineering machine shop, where I teach third- and fourth-year undergraduate students to use milling machines. Through my time in the machine shop, I have also gained experience using lathes (manual and CNC) and welding.</p>

		<p class="main_text">To learn more about my academic and professional experience, you can check out my <a class="intext" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasfrench252/">LinkedIn profile</a> or download my <a class="intext" href="media/ThomasFrenchResumePublic.pdf" download="ThomasFrenchResume">resume</a>.</p>

		<p class="main_text">Outside of school, I spend my time playing sports (soccer, basketball, squash, cycling, skiing, skating, golf), reading (fiction and non-fiction), and collecting records.</p>

		<p class="main_text">Here's a list of some books that I've enjoyed recently:</p>
