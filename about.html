		<h1>about me</h1>

		<div class="underline"></div>
		
		<p class="main_text">I am a masters student in the <a class="intext" href="https://ice.gadsden.xyz/">Intelligent and Cognitive Engineering Laboratory</a> in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at McMaster University. My research centres on fault detection and condition monitoring for 7-degree-of-freedom robots, with a focus on space applications. Over the course of my masters degree I have worked with a team of graduate students students to design and build a custom 7-DOF robot arm equipped with powerful motors and high-resolution sensors. My goal is to use the robot to build a robust dataset of common manipulator faults, and using this dataset I will develop novel machine learning-based fault detection techniques.</p>
		
		<p class="main_text">Outside of the lab, I spend my time playing sports (soccer, basketball, squash, cycling, skiing, skating, golf), reading (fiction and non-fiction), and playing chess.</p>
